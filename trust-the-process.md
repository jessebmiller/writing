# Trust The Process

Something engaging and interesting about Sam "he died for our sins" Hinkey and Joel "The Process" Embiid.

## Trust the process
Long enough to improve the process with the benefit of hindsight.

## The De La Cruz Method
Read a lot of plays (business requirements?) The playwright equivilent is an unrecognized discipline

Decoding

Mise en scene/mise en produit

Edgardo's "Versions", perhaps experiences, personas or contexts through which the product may be intrepreted

Permenant teams who share a vision is best. But lacking a team who shares a vision, temporary teams is better than a permenant team that does not share vision.

Never underestimate your audience/users intelligence and sensitivity

Simplicity and clarity

"analyzing my experience of the show, not the text"

### Discipline in stillness
Be still long enough to see beyond the surface of things

"The [PM] who is too busy playing the [PM] misses the substance of the [product], which is not about the rules but about the heart." - Edgardo Bengson De La Cruz

### Trust who came before

The biggest waste you have is repeatedly learning, the hard way, lessons that either you or others have already learned

Stand on the shoulders of giants

Don't reinvent the wheel

Understand and learn the current state of the art in order to build on it

### Iterate with hindsight

Learn from your mistakes but only after enough experience and only after enough of an honest attempt.

### Do the math. Do the research. Do the science. Pull the goalie

Learn and use the methods available to you to make the right decisions. 

### Kill your darlings

Learn to let your favorite ideas go when they don't serve the mise-en-produit.

### Constraints build creativity, start with them

The A3s the thing, it is the script of the product.
OKRs

### Simulate annealing

Start with lots of options, fast, hot, wild, exploratory.

On a cooling schedule, perform the production steps for your product.
Experiment with performing these cycles in both phase gate and continuous styles.

1. Chose a subset of options
2. Perform the next step on the options if it can be completed on schedule
3. Review, and set asside options whose next step was not completed
4. Repeat until production release

### Deconstruct

### Listen to everyone

Communication is the bottleneck of your process, and listening is the bottleneck of your communication.

In a team of five people, if everyone is talking an equal amount (aka, the team is intelligent), you are listening 80% of the time and talking 20% of the time.

In an organization of 500 people, if everyone is talking an equal amount, you are ... ;)
I know this sounds impossible, and the 500 person example probably is, but the more everyone listens, the more communication is happening.

### Take and give notes

Optimize interruption batch size.
Practice stillness before responding.
Continue listening while crafting what to say

### Take risks

### Stay humble, honest, and direct

### Read scripts you like until you have something to say

### Don't build your own designs

A tension between the designer (the problem creator) and builder (the problem solver) will pull the product towards the feasible solution that best meets the vision.

### Address issues before you are fed up

### Group intelligence except for emergencies and specialized expertise

In emergencies, have a strong coordinator
When specialized expertise is needed, listen to the expert rather than talk about it.

### Yes and

Accept and build upon the direction that others in the team offer.
No kills all momentum.

## Trust librarians

Look to library science for knowledge management
Prioritize it. It helps communication which is the bottleneck

### Learn "how to solve it"

1. Understand your goal
   1. Write it down
   1. Introspect
   1. Self awareness
   1. It could take your whole life for some, or you could know right away for others.
   1. Understanding your values helps
   1. Understanding the world helps
1. Devise a plan to achieve it
   1. Write it down
   1. Do research
1. Carry out the plan
   1. Execute <--- the most important part ;)
   1. Find the tools and processes that help you execute (calendars, todo lists, GTD etc.)
1. Look back with the benefit of hindsight
   1. Revise the process if pragmatic
   1. Consider other applications for what you did
   1. Consider other goals that may have come into view

* You can be executing the process in parrallel
* Heavily weight those lines of progress that are closest to being executed and achieved, but not to the exclusion of the rest of the process
* Understand and plan when the muse is amused, or when you are not well planned, or find yourself executing without knowing the goal or why

* Hammoc Driven Development
* How to Solve It
* Getting Things Done
* Kanban
