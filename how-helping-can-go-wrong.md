# How Helping Can Go Wrong

Sometimes jumping into a situation and doing something to help can cause more confusion than it's worth.

Guitar player who turns up the trim on their monitor ends up ruining the mix for themself when the audio engineer, who knows that monitor needs to be turned up does their job.

Two people trying to help but not coordinating both mute a noisy member of a video call, nothing happens, everyone is confused.
