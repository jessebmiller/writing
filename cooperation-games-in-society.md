# Notes

In a social netork big enough to have strangers, the liklyhood of any interaction being the 
last one in a chain will degrade the advantage of playing tit-for-tat. Also as long as
there are many (enough to saturate attention) independant cooperation games going, the
value of defecting suddenly goes up.

If you have 10 cooperation games going but only have the attention for 7 of them, you get
to choose which and when 3 of them end. The strategy for ending them is to defect.

Reputation joins these cooperation games into one big cooperation game by using information
about other peoples games as input into your own tit for tat algorythm.

Reputation is audit data about the past behavior of individuals. by default it is audited
by our imperfect memories and unstantiated gosip.
