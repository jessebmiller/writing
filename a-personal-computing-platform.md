# Fern - A Personal Computing Platform

My new laptop just arrived which means it's time again to think about how to set it up.

After leaving windows behind with the 20th century I used Linux then OSX, and now plan to go back to Linux. This will be the story of that transition and a description of the systems I set up for my own personal computing. I'll discuss the design goals, and the tools I use or build to achieve them. This system has spent over a decade in my mind, working itself out, becoming cohesive and internally consistent. 

# Notes
* State should be online "in the cloud" but on infrastructure I own, serving only for me and for those I share it with.
* The entire system should be permenant, last my lifetime independantly of any single device currently running or using the system.
* New devices and hardware should join the system easily and simply.
  * things like PXE boot for everything to make hardware and devices interchangable and independant of the software.
* Long term is should be social, in that it should interact and cooperate with other running instances of the system for things like mutual backup, spare compute amortization, etc.
  * It's very important for this to be personal first, and social second. All communal features and interactions must be opt in.
