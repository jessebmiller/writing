# My Process

Trust the process (long enough to get the benefit of hindsight, then look back and update the process).

Consistently make progress*.

*Progress: Changes to the world that achieve your goals.

1. Understand your goal
   1. Write it down
   1. Introspect
   1. Self awareness
   1. It could take your whole life for some, or you could know right away for others.
   1. Understanding your values helps
   1. Understanding the world helps
1. Devise a plan to achieve it
   1. Write it down
   1. Do research
1. Carry out the plan
   1. Execute <--- the most important part ;)
   1. Find the tools and processes that help you execute (calendars, todo lists, GTD etc.)
1. Look back with the benefit of hindsight
   1. Revise the process if pragmatic
   1. Consider other applications for what you did
   1. Consider other goals that may have come into view
