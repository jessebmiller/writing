# An Organizations Purpose

The purpose of an organization is to better the lives of its members. A rational
organization betters the lives of its members while also bettering the lives of
people who interact with it, the society it overates in.

# Criminal organizations

A criminal organization betters the lives of its members at the expense of the
lives of the society it operates in.
