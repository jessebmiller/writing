# An Organizations Purpose

The purpose of an organization is to better the lives of its members. A rational
organization betters the lives of its members while also bettering the lives of
people who interact with it, the society it operates in.

# Criminal organizations

A criminal organization betters the lives of its members at the expense of the
lives of the people who interact with it, the society it operates in.

# Notes
* As an organization grows, the bredth of it's scope will mean that for any given
  decision a lower percent of the org will care about the decision. Efficiently
  mapping the people who care about a decision to the making of the decision
  should be a goal of any governance system
