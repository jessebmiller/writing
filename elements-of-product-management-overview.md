# Elements of Product Management: Overview

# Principles

1. People over processes
1. Responsibility over authority
1. Objectives over roles
1. Outcome over output
1. Communication over intellect

# People

People are the most important and impactful part of any endeavor. The right people for an endeavor don't need much direction, management, or process to succeed in that endeavor. Processes help streamline effort, and are important, but have nowhere near the impact that the people do. A good process can only hone a team of people who are already driven and well suited for an endeavor, it cannot make up for people who are not well suited, or driven.

Good process reduces communications overhead and is foundational for efficient coordination of driven people but process cannot have good ideas; process does not have drive; process cannot innovate. It can only support the driven, working in good faith.

# Responsibility

Create durable teams with clear responsibilities.
