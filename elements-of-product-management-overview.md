The only rational purpose of any organization is to make it's members
lives better. When it's members know the theory of how it'll make
their life better, have relevant expertise and agency in how that
theory is executed the members lives will better on two fronts, the
theory will be executed in ways that far exceed the capacity of any
one member, and the members will have the satisfaction of seeing their
ideas and agency succeed.

# Principles

1. People over processes
1. Communication over intellect
1. Responsibility over authority
1. Goals over roles
1. Outcome over output

# People

People are the most important and impactful part of any endeavor. The
right people for an endeavor don't need much direction, management, or
process to succeed in that endeavor. Processes help streamline effort,
and are important, but have nowhere near the impact that the people
do. A good process can only hone a team of people who are already
driven and well suited for an endeavor, it cannot make up for people
who are not well suited, or driven.

Good process reduces communications overhead and is foundational for
efficient coordination of driven people but process cannot have good
ideas; process does not have drive; process cannot innovate. It can
only support the driven, working in good faith.

"Casting is the directors only job" - Edgardo De La Cruz

If you only work with people you trust, you can trust the people you
work with.

# Responsibility

Trust teams by building them with clear stable responsibilities and
accountability. Clear constarints and expectations dramatically help
people focus. When those constraints and expectations are strategic
from the members vantage they can bring their entire selves and all
their expertise to the tactics of achieving the goal.
