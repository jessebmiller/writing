# Elements of Product Practice: Overview

* Trust the process
  * Values
  * Vision
  * Mission
  * Strategy
  * Goal setting (OKRs)
  * Understanding opportunities (A3s)
  * Projects (Theatre)
  * Quality Work (Kanban and Andon)
  * Process Improvement (Kaizen)

* The broad strokes (from How to Solve It)
  * Understand the problem
  * Devise a plan
  * Carry out the plan
  * Look back

* Visualize the flow

* What deadlines are for

* Continuous Simulated Anealing

* Slack, queuing theory
  * The thing about firefighters and free time
  * 100% utilization is infinate lead time

The only rational purpose of any organization is to make it's members
lives better. When it's members know the theory and strategy of how
it'll make their life better, have relevant expertise and agency in
how that theory is executed, and are supported by a process that
facilitates efficient cooperation the members lives will better on two 
fronts, the strategy will be executed in ways that far exceed the capacity
of any one member, and the members will have the satisfaction of seeing
their ideas and agency succeed.

In order to support the goals of focused functional expertise, cross
functional product collaberation, and capture market opportunities fast,
I propose a matrix modeled after 3M as described in the lean development
reference article by Mary Poppendieck.

## Foundational functional departments

*Compete on the basis of expertise*
*Carpenters union*

The bedrock of this method is the functional department. These departments
are responsible for maintaining and progressing state of the art technical
capabilities to be leveraged in product teams as they compete in markets.
Functional departments provide training, carreer development, conduct and
publish (internally or externally) primary research, build tools of the
function. They do it on a flexible timeline providing the slack for the
product teams they are also on.

Functional projects have flexible timelines but strict scope.

## Product teams with agility

*Compete on the basis of speed*
*Cathedrial project*

The functional expertise in these departments are organized into product teams
in order to compete in markets on the basis of speed. These teams operate to
minimize lead time in order to learn the markets, find product market fit, then
compete to establish and broaden market leadership.

Product projects have flexible scope but strict timelines. 


# Principles

1. People over processes
  a. Processes that support people
1. Communication over intellect
1. Responsibility over authority
1. Goals over roles
1. Outcome over output

# People

People are the most important and impactful part of any endeavor. The
right people for an endeavor don't need much direction, management, or
process to succeed in that endeavor. Processes help streamline effort,
and are important, but have nowhere near the impact that the people
do. A good process can only hone a team of people who are already
driven and well suited for an endeavor, it cannot make up for people
who are not well suited, or driven.

Good process reduces communications overhead and is foundational for
efficient coordination of driven people but process cannot have good
ideas; process does not have drive; process cannot innovate. It can
only support the driven, working in good faith.

"Casting is the directors only job" - Edgardo De La Cruz

If you only work with people you trust, you can trust the people you
work with.

# Responsibility

Trust teams by building them with clear stable responsibilities and
accountability. Clear constarints and expectations dramatically help
people focus. When those constraints and expectations are strategic
from the members vantage they can bring their entire selves and all
their expertise to the tactics of achieving the goal.
