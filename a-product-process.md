# People

People are the most important and impactful part of any endeavor. The right people for an endeavor don't need much direction, management or process to succeed in that endeavor. Processes can help streamline effort, and are important, but have nowhere near the impact that the people do. A good process can only hone a team of people who are already well suited for an endeavor, it cannot get value from people who are not already well suited to the endeavor.

Process can only reduce communications overhead, it cannot crete good ideas.
