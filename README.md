# writing

I'm not really a writer, but I've got things to say.

## Prompts

* The hedonic treadmill, incrementalism, and my personal philosophy and process
* Do the math (pull the goalie)
* Proposition and curation are sufficient for progress
* Decentralizing the Toyota Production System
  * Trusting the employees so much that the organization disolves
* Batch size
* smaller casts make better shows, the director has to spend time on the weakest link, with a smaller cast that link is higher.
* Don't build your own designs.
* Deadlines can be absolute if scope is flexible, and you prioritize a working product early then iterate.
* When the shit hits the fan you will always do what you rehearsed
