I'm an incrementalist with things to say.

## Prompts

* Cryptoeconomics will erode the power of executive and middle management by offering the exponential returns to the workers and levorage the efficiency of markets for all the roles that management currently plays.
* Cake in the face antipattern
* How arbitrary deadlines help us do our best work, and some practical methods for doing this well
  * by forcing curation
  * set based design
  * Start with an easy solution, then iterate
* The hedonic treadmill, incrementalism, and my personal philosophy and process
  * Because of the hedonic treadmill, high stakes entreprenuership is a bad deal
* Do the math (pull the goalie)
* Proposition and curation are sufficient for progress
* Decentralizing the Toyota Production System
  * Trusting the employees so much that the organization disolves
* Batch size
* smaller casts make better shows, the director has to spend time on the weakest link, with a smaller cast that link is higher.
* Don't build your own designs.
* Deadlines can be absolute if scope is flexible, and you prioritize a working product early then iterate.
* When the shit hits the fan you will always do what you rehearsed
* The level of detail to which one can productively plan (brainstorming? prototyping? production engineering?) is directly coorilated to the level of detail of one's current practical knowledge of one's goal and it's achievement.
  * One is rewarded for planning and executing at the appropriate level with the purpose of increasing the level of detail in one's practical knowledge of one's goal and it's achievement.
* Rule for life: Study a range of collaborative disciplines, including theatre and science, get a mix of abstract and concrete, old and new.
* If you don't get into the altMBA, go do some theatre
