The radical claim
We confidently prioritize highest business value work and are able to make high integrity date commitments with the process outlined in this document. It reduces priority shift churn, lets everyone know the business value of their work and achieves project goals on time and under budget consistently.

Goals
First understand the higher order goals a project is supporting. Then investigate and clarify the relevant current conditions, goals, and outcomes that support those higher order goals.

Appetite
Decide with team leadership and the stakeholders of those higher order goals what your appetite for the project is. Ones appetite for a project is the budget in time, resources, capacity, risk, and so on they are willing to bet on the project.

Management
There are four variables a project team can manipulate in order to affect the project outcomes. These are capacity, quality of work, scope, and deadline. Manipulating capacity, hiring new team members for instance, helps in the long term, but not in the short term. A high quality of work is non-negotiable. Therefor we are left with the task of manipulating deadlines and scope in ways that consistently meet and exceed project goals.

In the large, at the project level, hold strict deadlines but allow for flexibility in what stories end up being included in the project. Set project goals that can be both reliably achieved and valuably exceeded depending on how the scope adjustments shake out when the project plan collides with reality.

In the small, at the story level, deadlines are flexible but scope is strict. Do now allow a partial story or a partial solution, and do not set strict deadlines for the completion of a story. Do however keep the stories small enough to leverage the law of averages to smooth out estimate variability and aim to plan work that achieves project goals early in the timeline, and can then be incrementally improved upon for the remainder of the project.

Schedule project planning meetings weekly for the entire duration of the project. Invite stakeholders and those involved in interdependent projects. Identify and give internal deadlines to any key coordination points between projects. Continue to refine the planned work to keep up with changing realities respecting what has already been achieved in the project. Reprioritize, refine, drop, and create work in order to optimize the outcomes according to the goal in the remainder of the time. While there are times that do require changing of deadlines or modification of goals, try hard not to change the goals or deadline of a project.

Let the constraints of deadlines and limited resources drive creativity and the selection of only the highest business value work.

Work
Project document and Epic Lifecycle:
Requirements: Goals and outcomes are written, cross team dependencies are worked out, timing is considered. An initial set of stories are created and attached, requirements for these are written. These stories should not be considered complete or comprehensive but should represent the core outcomes.

Refinement: Delivery teams are introduced to the project goals and plan. They refine, split, expand on the stories therein. They may split off child epics with their own goals, outcomes, coordination points, and deadlines. They confirm and coordinate with any cross-team dependent epics or stories. Identify the set of stakeholders who should be invited to the regular planning meetings once the project is in progress.

In Progress: Plans are things that change. Continuously refine projects throughout their execution in regularly scheduled planning meetings. Continue to refine the scope of the project as work and time uncovers the differences between the plan and reality, and as business priorities and realities change. Work hard to maintain the deadline as changing project deadlines can affect external plans. Ruthlessly uncover and remove unnecessary scope, according to the project goals and changing realities, to make time for what’s truly valuable.

Any new work added to a project in progress must be evaluated in terms of the existing scope it pushes out of the project, or its effect on the deadline. Prefer identifying and removing lower value work from the project scope to extending the deadline.

In Review: Hold a project retrospective, document what went well and what didn’t. Look for opportunities to improve the process. Consider business opportunities that have opened up due to the result of the project, consider alternate applications of the achievements or lessons from this project.

Done: Project and retrospective is complete and published.

Will Not Do: Project is abandoned or rejected for whatever reason

Terms
Project: A goal, a budget/appetite (time, resources), and the documents, communication, and work directed to achieve the goal, on time, and under budget.

Project Goal or Objective: A concrete, tangible, qualitative, inspirational aspiration that can confidently be achieved by a team in a timeframe.

Outcome or result: A concrete, tangible, quantitative, achievable result that measures the achievement of some goal

Project goals, objectives, outcomes, and results are written for a stakeholder audience. They are conservative in order to allow for high integrity date based commitments to be made and trust to be built.

Stretch Goal or Objective: A specific difficult, but not impossible to achieve goal set by a team or individual to reach for what they can achieve

Key Outcome or Result: A quantitative result that is difficult but not impossible to achieve within the objective timeframe

Stretch goals, objectives, outcomes, and results are written by teams and individuals for themselves. They are aggressive or radical in order to push for the author's potential height of achievement of the project goals, objectives, outcomes, and results.

Regular Planning Meetings
Hold regular project planning meetings weekly to continuously plan projects in progress.

Attendees: PMs, Stakeholders, and Key team members of a set of dependent projects.

Agenda:

Update the group on progress, challenges, and any risks that have come up

Reprioritize or replan where necessary

Coordinate any research, planning, problem solving work that is needed but outside the scope of the meeting.

Prepare updates for the owner of the higher order objectives this rolls up to

Enough prioritization for delivery teams to get a view of the current project and work priority and plan sprints

Views
Project document
Project documents that are simple, concise, and short enough to read. These should be cross linked to the relevant Jira epics and should state:

the objective

key results

current conditions

manager and stakeholders

cross team dependencies

coordination timelines

Planning meeting schedule

Project planning structure
A manual structure maintained by the TPM. It should categorize

Upcoming and speculative future projects in need of requirements

On deck projects in need of refinement

In Progress projects in need of regular planning

Completed projects in need of retrospectives
